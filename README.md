Project 5: Create a web app using Flask.

```
pip install flask
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
pip install flask-wtf
```

# Goal
I was hoping that could have a functioning web app that would allow the user to add bands to the database, view those bands in said database, and then
search through it with price or name filters to pick certain ones.

# How to use
How this site works is pretty simple. You can click on my name that will take you
to a page that says howdy to me, thank you :D . The add band part of the navbar
will take you to the page that lets you input information for a band in three
separate fields: Band Name, Year Formed, and Price. I'm not sure what price means,
but I believe my idea was to have prices that way you could search for bands or 
purchase bands for a price.
