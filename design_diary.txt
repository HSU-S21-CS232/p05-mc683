This project although exciting and interesting to get into I found myself feeling completely lost throughout the majority of this. I didn't really understand what I was supposed to be doing so because of that I think I spent way too much time working with the html aspect of this project which made it look interesting. Getting the databasee to properly store the information that I wanted it to and being able to have it display on a different page was pretty neat. If I had to give any advice to myself at the beginning of this project I would stress that I need to ask for more clarity, because thinking you know what you need to do isn't the same as knowing what you need to do. An issue that I ran into initally that I was able to work out was this issue with having the data get correctly stored into the proper variables that way when I pulled it up on the page it would display. Maybe I'm just feeling a little spacey because I had a lot of other class work going on, but overall my experience with this was fun and informative. I was hoping that I could transfer my Flask knowledge to my github page, but it seems like I'll need to find another way when it comes to that. The most difficult aspect of this assignment for came down to understanding what exactly was happening because of some other part of my code. My reason for saying that is because I used the help of a video that showed how to do certain things giving examples, so I would follow along and make those examples. By the time you get towards the end you have created so many examples and some of the examples I just rigged to be specific to what I need when I finally decided to clean up and remove examples I end up having errors pop in different places because it was connected to a different part of my code. I removed some of those things from the web app face of my project, but if we look inside of my files there are some things that are still lingering.
